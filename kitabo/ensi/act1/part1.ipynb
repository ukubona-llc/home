    "_Commodification_. Dave Chappelle‚Äôs battle with a network that sought to commodify his name and essence ‚Äúin perpetuity throughout the universe‚Äù is a modern allegory of alienation. This is not merely a legal dispute over contractual terms; it is a clash over the soul of artistry, the interplay of identity, morality, and meaning. Chappelle‚Äôs insistence that the integrity of an artist‚Äîtheir soul, mind, and body‚Äîcannot be separated reflects a rejection of the capitalist reduction of human creativity into an alienated product. Through the lens (yellow node) of neural network, we believe a person should own their autobiography, since art is essentially autobiography in its [perspective](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/174/174-h/174-h.htm#chap00).
