**E-Verify** and **E-Verify+** are both employment eligibility verification tools, but **E-Verify+** is a new, enhanced version of the original **E-Verify** system. Here‚Äôs a blunt breakdown of the key differences, with some opinion thrown in because the plain government language is often coma-inducing:

---

### üßæ **E-Verify (Classic)**  
- **What it is:** A voluntary (but sometimes mandatory) web-based system employers use to confirm their new hires are legally allowed to work in the U.S.  
- **How it works:** Employers enter information from an employee‚Äôs Form I-9, and E-Verify checks it against government databases (SSA and DHS).  
- **Who uses it:** Required for federal contractors and in certain states; voluntary elsewhere.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - Often clunky.  
  - Delays when info doesn‚Äôt match.  
  - Workers don't interact directly‚Äîit's employer-facing.  
  - Doesn‚Äôt proactively prevent I-9 errors.

### üöÄ **E-Verify+ (New and Spicy)**  
- **What it is:** A beefed-up version of E-Verify, launched in 2024. It's designed to streamline the entire **Form I-9 and employment eligibility verification process**, integrating it all in one smooth digital process.  
- **Key upgrades:**  
  - **Employee Self-Service:** Workers can enter and resolve their own info before even showing up for work.  
  - **Remote Verification Ready:** Includes **photo match**, digital ID upload, and some remote capabilities‚Äîhuge in a post-COVID, hybrid world.  
  - **More automation:** Cuts down on manual HR headaches.  
  - **Mobile-friendly interface.**  
- **Who it‚Äôs for:** Still rolling out, but likely to become the new gold standard, especially for remote-heavy or tech-forward employers.

### ‚öñÔ∏è **Which is better?**
- **E-Verify+** is objectively more modern, humane, and efficient. It shifts some burden from HR to the individual‚Äîarguably empowering, but also a bit like letting Uber passengers run their own background checks.
- If you're **a small business** or not required by law to use either, it depends on how digital and compliance-focused you want to be.  
- For **larger employers**, **E-Verify+** will probably become the expectation.

---

### üß† My Take:  
**E-Verify was built for a paper-pushing past; E-Verify+ is trying to catch up to the world of remote work, digital IDs, and less bureaucratic pain.** If you‚Äôre setting up a new company (like *Ukubona* üëÄ), E-Verify+ is the way to future-proof your onboarding flow‚Äîespecially if your analyst (say, Vincent) is on OPT and time is tight.
